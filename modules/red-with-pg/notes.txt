melezhik 12:36:14
yeah, I don't see how can an user provide a different driver, for example Pg?
SmokeMachine 12:36:42
RED_DATABASE=Pg mi6 test
it also accepts something like:
melezhik 12:37:09

SmokeMachine 12:37:33
RED_DATABASE="Pg host=localhost database=my_database" mi6 test
melezhik 12:37:39
give me some time, I think I'll be able to bring environment back in day or too 
SmokeMachine 12:38:15

melezhik 12:38:29
